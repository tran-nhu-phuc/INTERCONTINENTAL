      "Why do we require a payment card for internet reservations?By securing your online reservation with a payment method, you are eligible for our Reservations Guarantee. If your reservation cannot be honoured, the host hotel will provide a room at, and transportation to, another convenient and comparable hotel, and pay for telephone calls to notify family of the lodging change. The host hotel will also pay the full cost of the first night's lodging rate, plus tax. Any advance deposit will be refunded.A credit or debit card must be presented upon check-in at the hotel.Booking with a debit card?Most IHG hotels and resorts place a hold on a debit card when it is presented at check-in. The hold amount varies depending on the rate type booked and can include the entire price of the stay, plus taxes, fees, and a deposit for incidental purchases. These holds are separate from, and in addition to, your billable charges. IHG hotels and resorts typically release the hold within 5 days of check-out once final payment has been received. Depending on your financial institution, funds may take up to 14 days or longer to be back in your account. InterContinental Hotels Group, its subsidiaries, affiliates, franchisees and agents are not responsible or liable for the loss of use of these funds or any overdraft charges.",
